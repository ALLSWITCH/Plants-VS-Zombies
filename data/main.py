"""
Module: main.py
Overview:
    The main function is defined here. It simply creates an instance of
    tools.Control and adds the game states to its dictionary using
    tools.setup_states.  There should be no need (theoretically) to edit
    the tools.Control class.  All modifications should occur in this module
    and in the setup module.
Imports:
    pygame as pg
    os,sys
    from . import setup,tools
    from .states import title
Functions:
    main()
